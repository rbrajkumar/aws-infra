pre-request:
- install terraform
- install aws cli and do configure your credentials, this app reads from your .aws folder

Instructions:

- cd <top>/web
- terraform init
- terraform init plan (if you wanna skip above or just 'terraform plan')
- terraform apply - for creating all resources related to EC2
- terraform destroy - for clean up
- note: if you feel bugged by command line confirmation, just add '-y' as argument.

Note:

- by default this will create security group with open access, once verified re-assign
required security group.
